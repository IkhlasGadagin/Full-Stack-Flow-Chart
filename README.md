![CodersGyan eBook API Demo](./src/assets/QRforFloW.jpg)
This is a complete **Full-Stack Authentication Flow** system built with **React**, **Redux**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT**. It includes user authentication, protected routes, token handling, global error management, and an integrated front-end and back-end architecture.

> 🖼️ **Note**: This project includes an image diagram that visually represents the entire flow of all the keywords and components described below—from front-end to back-end. It is highly recommended to refer to the diagram for a better understanding of the architecture and data flow.

## 📊 Flow Diagram

The architecture of this project is illustrated in the included **flow diagram image**, which covers:

- LocalStorage and token management
- Component-based rendering (DOM, useEffect, useState)
- Authentication middleware
- Express route controllers and validation
- MongoDB model schemas and Mongoose
- Error handling using Express middleware

This image helps you **visualize the complete full-stack authentication lifecycle**.

🔐 Authentication Flow Summary
Register/Login on the frontend.

Backend validates credentials & returns a JWT.

JWT is saved in localStorage.

Protected routes require JWT in request headers.

Middleware verifies the token and grants access.

Errors are caught by the global error handler.
